                        Yes! The best thing about Wellbeing is that it's an all-in-one platform. You don't need a separate intermittent fasting app, or different apps for water tracking, weight tracking, or fitness tracking. All Wellbeing members can track their weight goals, exercise, and water intake alongside calories and nutrition.

                    <AccordionBody className="px-4 py-2">
                    Yes, Wellbeing uses a BMR calculator to help you set calorie goals. During signup, you'll be asked questions about your height, weight, age, and sex to estimate your BMR (basal metabolic rate). You can also estimate your own BMR with our BMR calculator. Depending on your weight goals, we either add or subtract calories from your daily calorie needs. To help you set safe weight goals during signup, we use a BMI calculator. BMI is based on the ratio of your weight to your height, and we don't allow you to set weight goals below a certain ratio.
